### This project is based on Egghead course [GraphQL Data in React with Apollo Client](https://egghead.io/courses/graphql-data-in-react-with-apollo-client). Here I am learning & practicing material from that course + materials from these as well:

- [GraphQL Query Language](https://egghead.io/courses/graphql-query-language)
- [Build a GraphQL Server](https://egghead.io/courses/build-a-graphql-server)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `yarn start`
